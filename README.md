### What I learned

This project gave valuable experience with using CSS Grid and animations to create a responsive layout.

- **Grid Template Areas**: I used `grid-template-areas` to define specific areas within the grid, making it easier to position elements precisely. This approach helped in creating a clear and maintainable layout structure.
- **Grid Area Assignment**: Assigning grid areas to specific elements using grid-area helped in positioning elements like the `header`, `.team-member`, and `external-link-container` effectively within the grid.
- **Keyframe Animations**: I implemented keyframe animations using `@keyframes` to create smooth transitions for elements when the page loads. This added a dynamic and engaging feel to the layout.
- **Animation Properties**: Properties like `animation-delay`, `animation-fill-mode`, and `animation-timing-function` were used to control the timing and behavior of animations, ensuring they played smoothly and in the desired sequence.

Overall, this project provided a great beginner challenge to get more familiar with creating more complex layouts for responsive and interactive web designs.
